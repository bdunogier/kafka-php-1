This is an alternative to the existing Kafka PHP Client which is in the incubator,
the main motivation to write this alternative was that it seemed important
that the fetch requests are not loaded entirely into memory but
pulled continuously from the socket as the fact that php request has a different control flow
and communication pattern (each request is a thread within http server)
so the api doesn't need to follow the scala/java object graph and can be much simpler.
 
There are few differences to the existing Kafka PHP client: 
- streaming message individually rather than loading the whole response into memory
- offset implemented by hexdecimal tranformation to fully support Kafka long offsets 
- flushing payload into the file to use gzopen function to enabled decompression (PHP gzdecode missing)
- TopicFilter abstract
- crc32 check working
- 

Try the cli example />php ./scripts/consumer.php 


TODO ProducerRequest
TODO process and act upon the errorCode after reading the response header
TODO maxSzize check when fetching and throw Kafka_Exception when overflown
TODO Snappy compression
TODO create Kafka class to hold connection properties but no actual socket (maybe put key constants there too)
